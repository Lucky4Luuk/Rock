# Rock
A Lua game-engine coded in Rust, heavily inspired by Love2D!

## TODO
- [ ] Framebuffer support (see [NOTES.md](NOTES.md))
- [ ] Scene loading
- [ ] Error handling (mostly related to `lua_api`)

## In progress
- [ ] Camera support (enables 3D)
- [ ] Custom mesh support (also loading from different filetypes)
- [ ] Material struct + Lua API for materials
- [ ] Textures (requires materials to be implemented first)
